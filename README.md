# Spring Mvc Base with Maven
The main idea is to provide a base template of spring mvc project configuration with Maven. The Spring java-based configuration was by annotations to replace the old configuration by XML.
Also I delete the classic file web.xml because we will use `AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer.class` which in this case acts as replacement of any spring configuration defined in web.xml

Technologies stack being used:
- JDK 1.8 (required)
- Spring Framework 5.0.3
- Maven 3.X

Best Regards.

Jose Solano.
